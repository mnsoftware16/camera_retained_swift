This is the improved version of the existing **camera_retrained** project (https://github.com/mnsoftware16/camera_retrained.git)

Example models used in the app are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ukLYoD-Pn4K-qfkvbeiJYbiJa7bXYO6e?usp=sharing

To use them please download "mlmodel" catalog and move its content to CameraRetrained -> Model -> mlmodel catalog available in the Xcode project.
